# transfer-learning-medical_image-diagnosis
machine learning classifer; retrain the 'inception v3' image classifier on the pneumonia dataset using Tensorflow+Keras

Transfer Learning on the Kaggle Pneumonia Dataset.
Google's pre-trained Inception v3 model is used
classify chest X-ray image with (or without) Pneumonia.

Tools/Library    : Python, Keras, TensorFlow

Version: 1.0.0 Basic starter model that i hope to improve in future to improve accuracy and loss
